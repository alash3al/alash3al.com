## Stack?
> I just wanted to create a fully functional service without any huge efforts from me,365-off consists of 8 micro-services deployed using a single `docker-compose` file on (1.65 gb ram, 1 cpu core) machine on google compute engine, these services are:
- [Scraply](https://github.com/alash3al/scraply/), a very tiny and simple scraping tool, each spider is just a simple `hcl` configuration file.
- [Puppeteer+Express API](https://github.com/zenato/puppeteer-renderer), for prerendering js based websites.
- Redis, as a caching solution only (with TTLs).
- Postgresql, for storing offers data.
- MainWebsite, reused [tabler](https://tabler.io) template as the main frontend.
- [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), for generating business related reports as well as aggregating analytical data from google analytics.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), to monitor each docker component.
- Woocommerce, for paid publishers (featured offers), there is a dedicated scraply spider for it.
- Slack, as free exceptions notifications
- Cloudflare, for optimizing the pageload performance as well ssl termination.
- [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/), helped in making the website PWA compatible app. 

> Not only that, but also there is slack notifications for any exception out there
